# Using Ghost

Example site that demonstrates how to build Gatsby sites that pull data from the
[Ghost Public API](https://www.ghost.org/).

IMPORTANT NOTE: To make this example work with your Ghost blog you will need to
find your clientSecretId and add your domain to the client trusted domains.
Instructions on how to do this can be found
[on the Ghost website](https://api.ghost.org/docs/ajax-calls-from-an-external-website).

To run use `yarn install && gatsby develop`
